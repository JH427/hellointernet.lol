      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I build systems that reduce complexity and make progress obvious.
        This usually means automation and software, but often includes
        process design, tooling decisions, and decision support.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on production systems that actually run; not demos,
        decks, or experiments that never leave the lab.
