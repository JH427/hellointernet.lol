  {
    question: "What do you actually do?",
    answer: "I reduce complexity until progress becomes obvious. Sometimes that looks like software. Sometimes it looks like a decision."
  },
  {
    question: "Are you an AI consultant?",
    answer: "No. I use AI the same way I use scripts, spreadsheets, or sharp knives; when it's the right tool."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build or advise?",
    answer: "Yes. Thinking without building is just theory. Building without thinking is expensive."
  },
  {
    question: "Who do you work best with?",
    answer: "People who can decide. Founders, operators, and teams who feel friction and want it gone."
  },
  {
    question: "How do engagements usually start?",
    answer: "Something is messy. Something is slow. Someone is tired of pretending it's OK."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your process?",
    answer: "Find the constraint. Build around it. Remove myself as soon as possible."
